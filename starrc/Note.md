This .ITF is designed for P&R (IC Compiler) to generate SDF.
This .ITF do not have precise information for transistors.

.ITF, information of metal layer thickness comes from paper [1].

technology co-optimization of back end of line design rules
for a 7 nm predictive process design kit,” in ISQED, 2017, pp. 149–154

Paper [1] did not show the layer dielectric, This .ITF use an assumption that
the layer dielectric has same thickness as metals. 
ER values comes from the other copper layer process.

asap07.itf.x1 is the original size (x1) layer information.

asap07.itf.x4 is the x4 expanded width and thickness from paper [1] 
to achieve realistic wire capacitance in P&R.

Both .nxtgd and tlu_plus can be generated by StarRC (see Makefile).
